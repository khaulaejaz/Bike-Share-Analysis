# Bike Share Analysis
## Project Overview

Bike Share Analysis is an exploratory data analysis project developed as part of a structured learning initiative in data analytics. The project was designed to replicate a real world analytical workflow, emphasizing data preparation, exploratory methodologies, and analytical reasoning using a large scale public dataset.

The objective of this project is to apply industry standard data analysis practices to examine rider behavior, usage patterns, and system level trends within a bike share program.

## Data Source

This analysis utilizes the Divvy Bike Share Trip Data (2022), a publicly available dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains detailed trip level information, including ride timestamps, rider classification, station details, and ride characteristics.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib

- seaborn

## Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

Prior to analysis, the dataset was systematically prepared to ensure data quality, consistency, and analytical reliability. The preparation phase involved standard data engineering and preprocessing practices, including:

- Data consolidation and integration across multiple source files

- Data cleaning to address missing values, invalid records, and inconsistencies

- Data type normalization and standardization

- Feature engineering to derive meaningful analytical variables, particularly time based attributes

- Structural formatting to support efficient exploratory and statistical analysis

This step established a clean and analysis ready dataset suitable for downstream exploration.
## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis was conducted using a structured and methodology driven approach to evaluate rider behavior, usage dynamics, and system trends. The analysis framework includes:

- ### Univariate Analysis 
Examination of individual variables to assess distributions, variability, and descriptive statistics through visual and numerical techniques.

- ### Bivariate Analysis
Comparative analysis with rider type (member vs casual) as the primary analytical dimension, evaluating its relationship with other variables to identify behavioral and usage differences.

- ### Temporal Analysis
Analysis of ride activity across multiple time granularities to identify seasonality, recurring patterns, and demand fluctuations.

- ### Station Level Analysis
Evaluation of station usage patterns to identify high traffic start and end locations and spatial distribution trends.

- ### Correlation Analysis
Assessment of relationships between numerical features to identify associations and potential dependencies within the dataset.

## Project Scope

This project focuses on exploratory and descriptive analysis and serves as a foundation for advanced analytical work. Insights derived from this analysis support a deeper understanding of rider behavior and operational characteristics within a bike share system.
